Note: trivial convertion is used (no fast path)
Starting the following conversion (10000 times):
  Input (source) in UTF-8 : war_and_piece.fb2
  Output (dest.) in UTF-16: temp.out
Processor settings:
  Fast path supports code points with up to 0 bytes in UTF-8
  Mode of input checking is: validate
  Using small processor, i.e. single stream / no unrolling
  Stops on any incorrect input

Read input buffer from file
Conversion (all runs) complete
Wrote output buffer to file

The task was finished in 51.005 seconds
Conversion result: success;   converted 999999 bytes -> 1143864 bytes
