Starting the following conversion (10000 times):
  Input (source) in UTF-16: temp.in
  Output (dest.) in UTF-8 : temp.out
Processor settings:
  Fast path supports code points with up to 3 bytes in UTF-8
  Mode of input checking is: validate
  Using small processor, i.e. single stream / no unrolling
  Stops on any incorrect input

Read input buffer from file
